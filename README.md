# Picture-In-Picture

The Simple Picture-in-Picture Viewer is a web application that enhances the user experience by providing a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode. This allows users to watch videos in a floating, resizable window, enabling multitasking while keeping the rest of the content visible. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the Picture-in-Picture functionality.

   - Set up the basic HTML structure with a video element and controls.

2. **CSS Styling:**
